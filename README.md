## Introduction

This project is a React application designed to interact with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets. It fetches content from a specified S3 bucket and displays it within the application.

## Features

- Fetches content from an AWS S3 bucket.
- Displays the fetched content within the React application.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codewithkim1/aws-s3-react-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd s3-react-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can run the React application:

```bash
npm start
  ```

This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser.

### AWS Configuration

Before running the application, make sure you have configured AWS credentials with access to the desired S3 bucket. Replace the placeholder values in the `S3Content.js` file with your actual AWS credentials and S3 bucket information.


 ### AWS S3 Configuration

Create a new instance of AWS S3 client with provided credentials and region:

```javascript
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID', // Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID' with your AWS access key ID
  secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', // Replace 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' with your AWS secret access key
  region: 'YOUR_REGION', // Replace 'YOUR_REGION' with the AWS region of your S3 bucket
});

```

### Define an asynchronous function to fetch content from the specified S3 bucket

```javascript
const fetchS3Content = async () => {
  try {
    // Define parameters for the S3 getObject operation, including the bucket name and file key
    const params = {
      Bucket: 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME', // Replace 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME' with the name of your S3 bucket
      Key: 'YOUR_FILE_KEY', // Replace 'YOUR_FILE_KEY' with the key of the file you want to fetch
    };

    // Call the getObject method of the S3 client to retrieve the content of the specified S3 object
    const data = await s3.getObject(params).promise();

    // Convert the binary data retrieved from S3 into a UTF-8 string and set it as the content
    setS3Content(data.Body.toString('utf-8'));
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors that occur during the S3 content retrieval process
    console.error('Error fetching S3 content: ', error);
  }
};
```

In the first block, we create an AWS S3 client instance with the provided credentials and region. In the second block, we define an asynchronous function to fetch content from the specified S3 bucket using the `getObject` method of the S3 client. Replace placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials and S3 bucket information.
